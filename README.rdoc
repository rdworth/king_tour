= KingTour - Royal On-Page Tours

You can make screenshots, movies or write a manual for your web app .. OR go for on-page tutorials.

On-Page tutorials, as the name suggests, live directly in your app. 
A user clicks his way through the web-application while reading your help bubbles 

A KingTour can serve as:

* Getting started tour
* Help
* Documentation with video and images
* Show-case your app within a demo account
* just about anything you can imagine, as long as it's html

amberjack was originally developed by Arash Yalpani. 
I would be glad to commit back to the origin if Arash puts up his sources on Github.
